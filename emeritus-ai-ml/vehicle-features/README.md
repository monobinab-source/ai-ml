# What Drives Car Prices

This project uses publicly available car data from used car dealerships. It contains 426K car data and 16 features that may have impact on car price. The application involves understanding of business problem, interpretation of statistocal analysis and modeling of data to be able to predict car prices. The application contains original dataset and working dataset after data cleansing, processing and feature engineering.

## The outcomes of this project include:
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Visualizations
3. Missing data imputation
4. Categorical variables encoding
5. Data Modeling
6. Cross validation and Hyper-parameter tuning
7. Analysis of Model Performances and evaluation

### Deliverables:
1. Jupyter Notebook - All codes exists here along with outputs
2. data folder - contains original dataset 
3. plots folder - contains two sub-folders:
    a. data_exploration - contains visualization of data distribution of feature variables
    b. model_performance - contains actual vs. predicted plots
